## ChIP-seq quality assessment

Prior to performing any downstream analyses with the results from a peak caller, it is best practice to assess the quality of your ChIP-seq data. What we are looking for is good	quality	ChIP-seq enrichment over background.

## Strand cross-correlation

A very useful ChIP-seq quality metric that is independent of peak calling is strand cross-correlation. It is based on the fact that a high-quality ChIP-seq experiment will produce significant clustering of enriched DNA sequence tags at locations bound by the protein of interest, that present as a bimodal enrichment of reads on the forward and reverse strands.

The bimodal enrichment of reads is due to the following:

During the ChIP-seq experiment, the DNA is fragmented and the protein-bound fragments are immunoprecipitated. This generates DNA fragments containing the protein-bound region.

The + strand of DNA is sequenced from the 5' end, generating the red reads in the figure below, and the - strand of DNA is sequenced from the 5' end, generating the blue reads in the figure below.

*Nat Biotechnol. 2008 Dec; 26(12): 1351–1359*

Due to the sequencing of the 5' ends of the fragments, this results in an enrichment of reads from the + strand (blue in the image below) being slightly offset from the enrichment of reads from the - strand (red in the image below). We need to **determine the number of bases to shift the peaks to yield maximum correlation between the two peaks**, which **should** correspond to the predominant **fragment length**. We can calculate the shift yielding the maximum correlation using the **cross-correlation metric**.

### Cross-correlation metric

The cross-correlation metric is computed as the **Pearson's linear correlation between the minus strand and the plus strand, after shifting minus strand by k base pairs.** Using a small genomic window as an example, let's walk through the details of the cross-correlation below.

<img src="../img/cc1.png" width ="500">

<img src="../img/cc2.png" width ="500">

<img src="../img/cc3.png" width ="500">

In the end, we will have a table of values mapping each base pair shift to a Pearson correlation value.

**Pearson correlation values are computed for *every peak* for *each chromosome* and values are multiplied by a scaling factor and then summed across all chromosomes.**

We can then **plot cross-correlation values (y-axis) against the shift value (x-axis)** to generate a cross-correlation plot.

The cross-correlation plot **typically produces two peaks**: a peak of enrichment corresponding to the predominant **fragment length** (highest correlation value) and a peak corresponding to the **read length** (“phantom” peak).

### Cross-correlation plot examples

**Strong signal**

High-quality ChIP-seq data sets tend to have a larger fragment-length peak compared with the read-length peak. An example of a **strong signal** is shown below using data from **CTCF (zinc-finger transcription factor)** in human cells. With a good antibody, transcription factors will typically result in 45,000 - 60,000 peaks. The red vertical line shows the dominant peak at the true peak shift, with a small bump at the blue vertical line representing the read length.

**Weak signal**

An example of **weaker signal** is demonstrated below with a **Pol2** data. Here, this particular antibody is not very efficient and these are broad scattered peaks. We observe two peaks in the cross-correlation profile: one at the true peak shift (~185-200 bp) and the other at read length. For weak signal datasets, the **read-length peak will start to dominate**.

<img src="../img/Pol2.png" width ="300">

**No signal**

A failed experiment will resemble a cross-correlation plot using **input only**, in which we observe little or no peak for fragment length. Note in the example below the **strongest peak is the blue line (read length)** and there is basically no other significant peak in the profile. The absence of a peak is expected since there should be no significant clustering of fragments around specific target sites (except potentially weak biases in open chromatin regions depending on the protocol used).

### Cross-correlation quality metrics

Using the cross-correlation plot we can **compute metrics for assessing signal-to-noise ratios in a ChIP-seq experiment** and to ensure the fragment length is accurate based on the experimental design. Poor signal-to-noise and inaccurate fragment lengths can indicate problems with the ChIP-seq data. These metrics are described in more detail below:

#### Normalized strand cross-correlation coefficent (NSC):

The ratio of the maximal cross-correlation value divided by the background cross-correlation (minimum cross-correlation value over all possible strand shifts).

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{max(CC&space;values)}{min(CCvalues)}" title="\frac{max(CC values)}{min(CCvalues)}" />

- higher NSC values indicate more enrichment (better signal:noise)
- low signal-to-noise: NSC values < 1.1
- minimum possible NSC value: 1 (no enrichment)

#### Relative strand cross-correlation coefficient (RSC):

The ratio of the fragment-length cross-correlation value minus the background cross-correlation value, divided by the phantom-peak cross-correlation value minus the background cross-correlation value.

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{max(CCvalues)&space;-&space;background}{phantomCCvalue&space;-&space;background}" title="\frac{max(CCvalues) - background}{phantomCCvalue - background}" />

- high enrichment: RSC values > 1
- low signal-to-noise: RSC values < 0.8
- minimum possible RSC value: 0 (no enrichment)


> **NOTE:** Low NSC and RSC values can be due to failed and poor quality ChIP, low read sequence quality and hence lots of mismappings, shallow sequencing depth or a combination of these. Datasets with few binding sites (< 200) could be due to biological reasons, such as a factor that truly binds only a few sites in a particular tissue type, which would output low NSC and RSC scores.


## `phantompeakqualtools`

The [`phantompeakqualtools`](https://code.google.com/archive/p/phantompeakqualtools/) package is a tool used to compute enrichment and quality measures for ChIP-seq data [[1](http://www.g3journal.org/content/4/2/209.full)]. We will be using the package to compute the predominant insert-size (fragment length) based on strand cross-correlation peak and data quality measures based on relative phantom peak.

### Set up

The `phantompeakqualtools` package is written as an R script, that uses `samtools` as a dependency. The package has various options that need to be specified when running from the command line. To get set up, we will need to start an interactive session, load the necessary modules and set up the directory structure:

```
$ srun -n 2 --mem 2000 -p classroom --pty bash
```
Before we start, we should index the alignment files that we generated in the last run.  We can use `samtools` for this.

```bash
$ module load SAMtools/1.7-IGB-gcc-4.9.4
$ cd ~/chipseq/results/bowtie2
```

> **NOTE:** If your automation script was successful, you should have alignment information for **all 6 files**. However, if you do not have these BAM files then you can copy them over using the command below:
>
>`$ cp /home/classroom/hpcbio/chip-seq/bowtie2/*.bam ~/chipseq/results/bowtie2/`

Notice that you may actually have 7 alignment files.  One was left over from our
initial alignment walkthrough (`H1hesc_Input_Rep1_chr12_aln.bam`).   We won't
use this going forward so it can be ignored; you can remove this but remember
that `rm` is  *irreversible*, so if you do so make sure to select the correct
file.  

Let's use a simple bash `for` loop (like we did in the script) to index the BAM files:

```bash
$ for i in *.bam
do
    samtools index $i
done
```

You should now see a `.bai` file for each BAM.  We'll need these later.

```
$ cd ~/chipseq/results

$ mkdir chip_qc

$ cd chip_qc
```
Now we can load in the module.

```
$ module load Phantompeaktools/1.2-IGB-gcc-4.9.4-R-3.4.1
```

What happened?  There was a collision with the module dependencies.  We can work around it
by unloading all the modules we currently have, then loading it in:

```
$ module purge
$ module load Phantompeaktools/1.2-IGB-gcc-4.9.4-R-3.4.1
```

> **NOTE:**  You can download the `phantompeakqualtools` package, directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/kundajelab/phantompeakqualtools), if you wanted your own local version. This repo is actively maintained by the developer Anshul Kundaje.

### Running `phantompeakqualtools`

To obtain quality measures based on cross-correlation plots, we will be running the `run_spp.R` script from the command line which is a package built on SPP. This modified SPP package allows for determination of the cross-correlation peak and predominant fragment length in addition to peak calling. We will be using this package solely for obtaining these quality measures (no peak calling).

The options that we will be using include:

* `-c`: full path and name (or URL) of tagAlign/BAM file
* `-savp`: save cross-correlation plot
* `-out`: will create and/or append to a file several important characteristics of the dataset described in more detail below.

First, we need to find the location of the R script that we use to run this.
It's set as an executable but can't be run without using R, so we use a little
Linux knowledge to work around this:

```
$ which run_spp.R
/home/apps/software/Phantompeaktools/1.2-IGB-gcc-4.9.4-R-3.4.1/run_spp.R

$ ln -s /home/apps/software/Phantompeaktools/1.2-IGB-gcc-4.9.4-R-3.4.1/run_spp.R .
```

If you list the directory it should look like this:

```
$ ls -l
total 1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 instru03 instru03 72 Nov 16 12:26 run_spp.R -> /home/apps/software/Phantompeaktools/1.2-IGB-gcc-4.9.4-R-3.4.1/run_spp.R
```

This is a symbolic link, which is just a pointer to the original file. You can
alternatively use the full path to the script when you invoke it using
`Rscript`, but then I couldn't show you what a symbolic link was.

Now, if you wanted to compute metrics on a single file you normally do this:

```
## DO NOT RUN THIS
## THIS SCRIPT IS FOR COMPUTING METRICS ON A SINGLE FILE
$ Rscript run_spp.R -c=<tagAlign/BAMfile> -savp -out=<outFile>
```
>_**NOTE:** Even though the script is called `run_spp.R`, we aren't actually performing peak calling with SPP._

From within the `phantompeakqualtools` directory, we will create output directories and use a 'for loop' to **run the script on every Nanog and Pouf51 BAM file**:

```
$ mkdir -p logs qual

$ for bam in ../bowtie2/*aln.bam
do
bam2=`basename $bam _aln.bam`
Rscript run_spp.R -s=-100:5:500 -c=$bam -savp -out=qual/${bam2}.qual > logs/${bam2}.Rout
done
```

The for loop generates **three output files**. The **quality metrics** are written in a tab-delimited text file, and the **log files** contains the standard output text. A third file is created in the same directory as the BAM files. These are pdf files that contain the **cross-correlation** plot for each sample. Let's move those files into the appropriate output directory:

```
$ mv ../bowtie2/*pdf qual

```

To visualize the quality metrics (.qual) files more easily, we will concatenate the files together to create a single summary file that you can move over locally and open up with Excel.

```
$ cat qual/*qual > qual/phantompeaks_summary.xls
```
Let's use MobaXterm or similar to move the summary file over to our local machine for viewing. Open up the file in Excel and take a look at our NSC and RSC values.

### `phantompeakqualtools`: quality metrics output

The qual files are tab-delimited with the columns containing the following information:

- COL1: Filename: tagAlign/BAM filename
- COL2: numReads: effective sequencing depth (i.e. total number of mapped reads in input file)
- COL3: estFragLen: comma separated strand cross-correlation peak(s) in decreasing order of correlation. (**NOTE:** The top 3 local maxima locations that are within 90% of the maximum cross-correlation value are output. In almost all cases, the top (first) value in the list represents the predominant fragment length.)
- COL4: corr_estFragLen: comma separated strand cross-correlation value(s) in decreasing order (col2 follows the same order)
- COL5: phantomPeak: Read length/phantom peak strand shift
- COL6: corr_phantomPeak: Correlation value at phantom peak
- COL7: argmin_corr: strand shift at which cross-correlation is lowest
- COL8: min_corr: minimum value of cross-correlation
- COL9: Normalized strand cross-correlation coefficient (NSC) = COL4 / COL8
- COL10: Relative strand cross-correlation coefficient (RSC) = (COL4 - COL8) / (COL6 - COL8)
- COL11: QualityTag: Quality tag based on thresholded RSC (codes: -2:veryLow,-1:Low,0:Medium,1:High,2:veryHigh)

> **NOTE:** The most important metrics we are interested in are the values in columns 9 through 11, however these numbers are computed from values in the other columns.

**How do the values compare to the thresholds mentioned above?** All samples have quite high NSC values indicating more enrichment, a good signal to noise and a fair number of peaks. Nanog-rep2 has a comparably higher NSC value which might explain the increased number of peaks for that sample compared to the others. The RSC and quality tags further indicate good chip signal and a quality IP, yielding a very high quality tag. Based on these metrics, the samples look good for further analysis.


### Cross-correlation plots

The cross-correlation plots show the best estimate for strand shift and the cross-correlation values. This file can be viewed by transferring it to your local machine using FileZilla. Copy `H1hesc_Nanog_Rep1_chr12_aln.pdf` to your machine to view the strand shift. The cross correlation peak shows the highest cross-correlation at fragment length 115.
